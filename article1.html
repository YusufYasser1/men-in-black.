    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The worldwide disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in numerous positive effects on the environment and climate. The global reduction in everyday human activity, such as the considerable decline in planned travel, caused a significant drop in air pollution and water pollution in many regions. In China, lockdowns and quarantine resulted in a 25 % reduction in carbon emissions and a 50 % reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions. An Earth systems scientist estimated that this decent reduction might have saved at least 77,000 lives over two-month. Till 2020, there was an increase in the net amount of greenhouse gases produced since the beginning of the industrialization era caused the average global temperature to rise, causing effects including the melting of glaciers and rising sea levels.
        Before the COVID-19 pandemic, measures that were expected to be recommended to health authorities in the case of a pandemic included quarantines and social distancing.
        In fact, before the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers argued that reduced economic activity would help decrease global warming and air and marine pollution, allowing the environment to flourish slowly. This effect has been observed following past pandemics in 14th century Eurasia and 16th-17th century North and South America. Researchers and officials have also called for biodiversity protections to form part of COVID-19 recovery strategies.

    <h2>CHAPTER 01</h2>
    <p>AIR EFFECT:
        Due to the pandemic's impact on travel and industry, the globe experienced a drop in air pollution. Reducing air pollution can reduce both climate change and COVID-19 risks, but it is not yet clear which types of air pollution are common risks to both climate change and COVID-19. The Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air reported that methods to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, such as quarantines and travel bans, resulted in a 25% reduction of carbon emission in China. In the first month of lockdowns, China produced approximately 200 million fewer metric tons of carbon dioxide than the same period in 2019 due to the reduction in air traffic, oil refining, and coal consumption. However, Sarah Ladislaw from the Center for Strategic and International Studies argued that reductions in emissions due to economic downturns should not be seen as beneficial. She stated that China's attempts to return to previous growth rates amidst trade wars and supply chain disruptions in the energy market would worsen its environmental impact. Between 1 January and 11 March 2020, the European space agency observed a marked decline in nitrous oxide emissions from cars, power plants, and factories in the Po valley region in northern Italy, coinciding with lockdowns in part. Also, from areas in North India such as Jalandhar, the Himalayas became visible again for the first time in decades, as air quality improved due to the drop in pollution.
        NASA and ESA have been monitoring how the nitrogen dioxide gases dropped significantly during the initial Chinese phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The economic slowdown from the virus drastically dropped pollution levels, especially in cities like Wuhan, China, by 25-40%. NASA uses an ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) to analyze and observe the ozone layer and pollutants such as NO2, aerosols, and other gasses affecting the ozone. This instrument helped NASA to process and analyze the data coming in due to the lock-downs worldwide. According to NASA scientists, the drop in NO2 pollution began in Wuhan, China, and slowly spread to the rest of the world. The decline was also very drastic because the virus coincided with the same time as the lunar year celebrations in China. During this festival, factories and businesses were closed for the last week of January to celebrate the lunar year festival. The drop in NO2 in China did not achieve an air quality of the standard considered acceptable by health authorities. Other pollutants in the air, such as aerosol emissions remained.
        Joint research led by scientists from China and the U.S. estimated that nitrogen oxides (NOx=NO+NO2) emissions decreased by 50% in East China from 23 January (Wuhan lockdown) to 9 February 2020 compared to the period from 1 to 22 January 2020. Emissions then increased by 26% from 10 February (back-to-work day) to 12 March 2020, indicating possible increasing socioeconomic activities after most provinces allowed businesses to open. It is yet to be investigated what COVID-19 control measures are most efficient in controlling virus spread and most negligible socioeconomic impact.
        According to the WHO, more than 80% of the cities citizens are exposed to dangerous air pollution, which has been associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 problems and mortality.
