        EXAMPLES
        Peru
        The Peruvian jungle experienced 14 oil spills from the beginning of the pandemic through early October 2020. Eight falls were in a single sector operated by Frontera Energy del Perú S.A., which ceased operations during the pandemic and is not maintaining its wells and pipes. The oil seeps into the ground contaminating the drinking water of indigenous people in Quichua territory.
        Italy
        In Venice, shortly after quarantine began in March and April 2020, water in the canals cleared and experienced greater water flow. The increase in water clarity was due to the settling of sediment disturbed by boat traffic. Also mentioned the decrease in air pollution along the waterways.

        Fish prices and demand for fish have decreased due to the pandemic, and fishing fleets around the globe mainly sat idle. German scientist Rainer Froese has said the fish biomass would increase due to the sharp decline in fishing. He also projected that in European waters, some fish such as herring could double their biomass. As of April 2020, signs of aquatic recovery remain mostly less than expected.
        As people stayed at home due to lockdown and travel ban, some animals have been spotted in cities. Sea turtles were spotted laying eggs on coasts they used to avoid (such as the coast of the Bay of Bengal) due to the lowered levels of human presence on the coast and light pollution. In the United States, fatal vehicle collisions with deer, elk, moose, bears, mountain lions dropped by 58% during March and April.
        Conservationists expect that African countries will experience a massive rise in bushmeat hunts. Matt Brown of the Nature Conservancy said that "When people do not have any other alternative for income, our prediction -- and we see this in South Africa -- is that poaching will go up for high-value products like rhino horn and ivory." On the other hand, Gabon decided to ban the human consumption of bats and pangolins from stemming the spread of zoonotic diseases, as SARS-CoV-2 was thought to have transmitted itself to humans through these animals. In June 2020, Myanmar allowed the breeding of endangered animals such as tigers, pangolins, and elephants. </p>

        A study published in May 2020 found that the daily global carbon emissions during the lockdown measures in early April fell by 17% and could lead to an annual carbon emissions decrease of up to 7%, which would be the most significant drop since World War II. They  Attributed these decreases mainly to the reduction of transportation usage and industrial activities. Regardless, societal shifts caused by the COVID-19 lockdowns – like widespread telecommuting and virtual conference technology – may have a long-term impact beyond the short-term reduction of transportation usage. In a study published in September 2020, scientists estimate that such behavioural changes developed during quarantine may reduce 15% of total transportation CO₂ emissions.
        Despite this, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was the highest ever recorded in human history in May 2020. Energy and climate expert Constantine Samaras states that "a pandemic is the worst possible way to reduce emissions" and that "technological, behavioural, and structural change is the best and only way to reduce emissions". Tsinghua University's Zhu Liu clarifies that "only when we would reduce our emissions even more than this for longer would we be able to see the decline in concentrations in the atmosphere". The world's demand for fossil fuels has decreased by almost 10% during COVID-19. Measures and reportedly many energy economists believe it may not recover from the crisis.
        In a study published in August 2020, scientists approximated that global nitrogen oxides emissions dropped by 30% in April. However, that declination was offset by an approximately 20% reduction in global SO₂ emissions that weakens the cooling effect. They also mentioned that the direct impact of the response to the pandemic on global warming would likely be negligible, with an estimated cooling of around 0.01 ±0.005 °C by 2030. Also, reducing fossil fuel investments could avoid future warming of 0.3 °C by 2050. The study indicates that systemic change in how humanity powers and feeds itself is required to impact global warming substantially.
        In October 2020, scientists reported, based on near-real-time activity data, a remarkable, unexpected 8.8% decrease in global CO₂ emissions in the first half of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, more extensive than during the previous economic slump and World War II. Scholars note that such decreases in human activities can not be the solution and that structural and transformational changes in human, financial management and behaviour systems are essential.
         January 2021, scientists reported reductions in the air due to worldwide COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 were more significant than previously estimated and conclude that, because of that, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the climate during that year was slight warming of Earth's atmosphere of the year, instead of slight cooling. They used climate models to identify minor impacts that could not be divine with observations. The study's lead author noted that aerosol emissions have major health complications besides global warming.</P>

         <P> 
        As a consequence of the extraordinary use of disposable face masks, a significant number of masks were abandoned in the natural environment, adding to the worldwide load of plastic waste. During the COVID-19 pandemic, plastics need for medical usage has increased noticeably in some countries, besides personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves. A considerable increase in plastic use has been related to requirements packaging and single-use items. These shifts in hospitals and regular life may collectively exacerbate environmental issues with plastics, which already existed even before the pandemic occurred.</P>
