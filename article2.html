        water effect Reports indicate that during COVID-19-induced lockdown, the air quality and water quality in rivers and water bodies are also improving. The stoppage of discharging industrial effluents and other wastes into water led to an apparent positive effect on water quality. India's holiest river Ganga has been one of the most polluted rivers in the world. Waste from domestic and industrial setups along the river banks cost the government millions without any success. According to the real-time water analysis of the Central Pollution Control Board of India (CPCB) and reports of Dr. Mishra, an IIT professor in Banaras Hindu University, a 40–50% improvement has been observed in the water quality of the Ganga River (CPCB 2020). The parameters monitored online were dissolved oxygen (more than 6 mg/L), biochemical oxygen demand (less than 2 mg/L), total coliform levels (5000 per 100 ml), and pH (range between 6.5 and 8.5). Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, has reported that the water of the Ganga River has become fit for drinking after decades. The Ganga and its sister river, the Yamuna, have been improved as dissolved oxygen (D.O.) has been recorded 2.3–4.8 mg/L in the Yamuna, which was considered null in 2019. Lockdown has been able to achieve what the governments could not for decades. Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) of India reveals that the biological oxygen demand (BOD) of the rivers Ganga and Yamuna has decreased in their most polluted stretches (CPCB 2020; UPPCB 2020). In Venice, the water is looking clearer after the two months of COVID-19 lockdown, and aquatic life is now visible, which hasn't been seen for many years.
        Clean rivers and other water bodies have a significant positive effect on aquatic life. Many species are returning to their natural habitats since the induction of the lockdown. The closure of factories and commercial establishments has dipped the pollution level across the globe. The land animals returning and even the sea creatures enjoy this break from the noise and water pollution. With many cruisers suspended, the tourism subdued while all other marine activities being suspended.

        Consequently, the aquatic species are taking control of their hands. Marine scientists have already started investigating the effects of lockdown on marine life. Commercial fishing industries have been hit hard due to the closure of main buyers, restaurants, and hotels. The social distancing at sea has caused the fishing vessels to be anchored at ports. Carlos Duarte, a research chair at the Red Sea Research Center (RSRC) in Saudi Arabia, said COVID-19 lockdown between February and June or July will accelerate the recovery of fish stocks and other marine organisms, as it already showed spectacular recovery after the 1st and 2nd world wars. This random lockdown will help us to grasp conservation aims faster. Sound travels much farther and more quickly in water than a so-called imagined plight of the aquatic life. The noise pollution from shipping and powerful blasts from the seismic air gun tests used to locate gas and oil deposits in the deep oceans must be traumatizing for marine life. Noise levels from shipping traffic are generally 20–200 Hz and disturb the aquatic life, decreasing by six decibels with a significant reduction below 150 Hz (GeoNoise 2020). The study of humpback whales and other marine life by Michelle Fournette, a marine ecologist at Cornell, said that removing just the cruise ships would bring about a massive instant change in the amount of ocean noise. The study states that the ambient noise from marine traffic increases stress hormone levels in marine creatures, affecting their reproductive success (Rolland et al., 2012). A study examining the feces of the right whales reveals that limited movement in the water was directly proportional to the lowering of stress hormones in these species. In addition, this lockdown is also providing a flawless condition for olive ridley turtles on the beaches. Turtles are less disturbed by tourists during this lockdown. The decreased human interruption this year would give these turtles enough time to incubate and hatch in peace. Since the beaches are people-free, no accidental crushing of eggs, less garbage, and plastics disposal to the marine environment. Indigestion and entanglement due to the plastic and marine debris, which are the leading causes of injuries to sea creatures, will be wiped out during this lockdown. The oceans and even the rivers and other water bodies are clearing out, indicating lesser toxic and harmful materials entrance to the water bodies.
        There have been visible positive signs of this lockdown, but a few weeks or months of lockdown will not be enough to eradicate or reverse the damage caused during many years. Data gathered by several studies can be utilized for devising better environmental policies. The lockdown gives us hope that there is a possibility of minimizing the unnecessary human interferences and letting these beautiful creatures back in their space and habitats. If the governments properly construct sewage treatment plants and make solid regulations for the companies and industries to treat their wastes accordingly, then the lockdown-induced eco-friendly impact on aquatic life can be long-lasting.
